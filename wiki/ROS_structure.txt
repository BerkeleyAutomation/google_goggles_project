====== ROS structure ======
Created Wednesday 23 January 2013

===== contact_cloud.py =====

=== ImageTester (image_tester.py) ===
* subscribes to image topic
* publishes object label

=== ObjectLoader (object_loader.py) ===
* subscribes to object label
* loads bag in ''data/points/ref''
	* cloud and/or mesh
	* grasps
* if bag only has cloud, calls cloud to mesh service to get object
* calls alignment service
	* if fake alignment, publishes ref object as aligned object
* publishes grasps
* if grasping enabled, waits 5 seconds, resets arms

=== Grasper (grasper.py) ===
* subscribes to:
	* table height
	* grasp/grasp array
	* cloud and/or mesh
	* object pose (opt)
* Grasp array:
	* Tests each grasp individually
	* If none successful, shifts table down, tries again
* Grasp:
	* wait for mesh (if cloud, uses cloud-to-mesh service)
	* add mesh to [[OpenRAVE]]
	* checks IK for poses:
		* pregrasp
		* grasp
		* lift
	* if valid:
		* publishes poses
		* executes

===== pose_estimator =====
* subscribes to object reference data
* services:
	* align object (mesh)
	* align cloud
* alignment of reference cloud:
	* get tf to center ref cloud on centroid
	* gets ref convex hull
	* gets latest sensor cloud
	* for each of 1000 random rotations:
		* gets approx alignment of cloud:
			* rotates ref cloud (rotate centered, tf back to original)
			* align x/y center with  center of sensor cloud
			* align bottoms
		* optional: remove occluded
		* aligns
			* input is ref cloud
			* target is sensor cloud
			* guess is approx alignment
